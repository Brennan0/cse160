I started the project with the basecode from threejs lighting models. I used some of the videos listed along with chatGPT to help me better understand how to work with Threejs. I thought this was really fun but I wish I had more time to polish and add more! 

For the wow factor, I was experimenting with particle effects with the smoking pen and the glass material for the cylinder on the table. I was able to introduce shadows and various reflective surfaces which I thought was pretty cool (if you align the star light with the table, you can see the table reflects differently from the sand texture)
