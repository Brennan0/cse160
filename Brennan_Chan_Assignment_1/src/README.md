For the awesomeness criteria, I just tried making the drawing program a bit better. For the triangles, I added in a rotation button to allow the user to rotate the triangle by 90 degrees every time you pressed the button. I also added the rotation to the performance texts to let the user know which rotation the triangle is currently on. I also added a new Lines class which creates a line from two points. It successfully creates a line between two mouse clicks and it also creates an interesting drawing when dragged. I thought dragging with the line shape created a chalk like stroke. I think this is because when dragging, you are essentially just making a large trail of repeating points. I tested this by dragging very quickly and made some lines and dotes. It was kind of similar to if you were to write with a pen almost out of ink. I tried to connect the size scroll to the thickness of the line, but I wasn't fully able to figure that out.
