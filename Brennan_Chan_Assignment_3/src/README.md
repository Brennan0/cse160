I got help from google ai as well as chatgpt for placing and deleting blocks. Everything else was from the course videos as well as the textbook.

For the Wow factor, I decided to add in my animal from the previous assingment and give it a little jumping animation. I also UV mapped grass blocks to make it look more like minecraft. 

My plan for the story was to build around the animal and protect it from the creeper.
